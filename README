Experimental PHP/JS crossword engine.

Make a crossword in a simple .ini format, and the PHP script will make
a page for it. The JS will provide navigation, clue highlighting, 
cheat/check functions, punctuation marks, and whatnot.

Crosswords courtesy of Envy from the Hackney Citizen.

Influenced by the utterly excellent free crosswords provided online 
by The Guardian in the UK. I wanted a page with a smaller proportion
of ad content so it would fit on a single Kindle screen.

This repo contains a script that can scrape Guardian crosswords, but
as I'm not sure what their reaction would be, I'm not going to provide
you with any scraped crosswords.

TODO : 

Multi-word clues are still a bit ropey
